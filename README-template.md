- [Overview](#Four Card Feature Section)
  - [The challenge](#layout)
- [My process]#I worked on my HTML and CSS through prior knowledge before utilising a tutorial by Kevin Powell as i continue to explore different practices from proffesionals in the field. my process has been to figure out what it is i want to create. What i will use being Flexbox or Grid then working simtimatcally within the html so that i can form my CSS.
- A key thing with this template was " Cascading order in my html"
  -- This meant also looking at the mobile version and thinking about how the layout will form once no longer in desktop. This worked nicely with Grid but i also explored my options with Flexbox.

- I particully enjoyed learning how to efficiently use nth-child() to specify my cards and likewise for the borders of my cards but chose to keep it simple.
  EXAMPLE:
  .card:nth-child(1) {
  grid-area: one;
  }
  .card:nth-child(2) {
  grid-area: two;
  }

        .card:nth-child(3) {
          grid-area: three;
        }

        .card:nth-child(4) {
          grid-area: four;
        }

  -- furthermore i added a slight variation that was not in the task but i enjoy adding to my cards.This was a :hover class which changed each cards box shadow to a lighter gradient of the initial border-top. See code below:

  .border-teal {
  border-color: var(--clr-primary-teal);
  }
  .border-red {
  border-color: var(--clr-primary-red);
  }
  .border-yellow {
  border-color: var(--clr-primary-yellow);
  }
  .border-blue {
  border-color: var(--clr-primary-blue);
  }

.border-teal:hover{
box-shadow: 0 1rem 1rem -.5rem hsl(180, 29%, 30%);
}
.border-red:hover{
box-shadow: 0 1rem 1rem -.5rem hsl(0, 38%, 38%);
}
.border-yellow:hover{
box-shadow: 0 1rem 1rem -.5rem hsl(34, 53%, 48%);
}
.border-blue:hover{
box-shadow: 0 1rem 1rem -.5rem hsl(212, 39%, 40%);
}

- [Built with](#HTML, CSS)
- [What I learned](#An efficeint way to build grids which are user friendly and easily readable. New techniques and fundamentals when sizing and structring my styles to the most efficient way possible.)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<!-- A Great example for your cards -->
<main>
  <div class="wrapper">
    <div class="layout-grid">
      <div class="card border-teal">
        <h2 class="card__title">Supervisor</h2>
        <p>monitors activity to identify project roadblocks</p>
        <img class="card__img" src="images/icon-supervisor.svg" alt="" />
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</main>
```

```css
/* CSS example of border-color on cards */
.border-teal {
  border-color: var(--clr-primary-teal);
}
.border-red {
  border-color: var(--clr-primary-red);
}
.border-yellow {
  border-color: var(--clr-primary-yellow);
}
.border-blue {
  border-color: var(--clr-primary-blue);
}

.border-teal:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 1rem 1rem -0.5rem hsl(180, 29%, 30%);
}
.border-red:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 1rem 1rem -0.5rem hsl(0, 38%, 38%);
}
.border-yellow:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 1rem 1rem -0.5rem hsl(34, 53%, 48%);
}
.border-blue:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 1rem 1rem -0.5rem hsl(212, 39%, 40%);
}
```

```
